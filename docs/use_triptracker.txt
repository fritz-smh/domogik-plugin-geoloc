Trip Tracker
============

Trip Tracker is an Android application which can send your position on an url with the POST method. The interval can be set from 5 min to 2 hours.

This is quite a basic application and 5 minutes can be too long for some usages, but it works :)

Sources are available on GitHub : https://github.com/jcs/triptracker

The APK can be found also on GitHub : https://github.com/jcs/triptracker/downloads

Set up Trip Tracker
===================

Launch Trip Tracker and set the url like this: ::

    http://<ip>:<port>/position/<device id>/

Example: ::

    http://192.168.1.10:40405/position/foobar/

Click on **Enable Tracking** and check on the screen that no error occurs. If this is ok, you should be able to see your current position with one of Domoweb map widgets.
